# RSI
"Rural Solar Innovation" is a project in Mont-Soleil. 
This git repository provides configuration information for OpenHAB 1.8 that is used as an 
insulation between the "things" in the building and the cloud.   

## Naming
We call all devices according to IoT "things". In the naming of OpenHAB such things have 
variables called "Items" 

## State of the Things
Most things are currently simulated through demo.rules and rsi.rules.

## State of the Cloud
The cloud is planned to run on Logstash or MongoDB, Elasticsearch and Kibana. 

## Known Issues
The logging out of OpenHAB for Logstash is currently not working.
